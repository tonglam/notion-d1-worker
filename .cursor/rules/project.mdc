## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First:** Keep the implementation lean without over-engineering or excessive layering.
- **Direct Integrations:** Interact directly with Cloudflare D1 and the Notion APIâ€”avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Operate strictly within Cloudflare's free quota, ensuring that all integrations and usage remain within the free tier limits.

## Application Logic
- **Single Responsibility:** Write your worker logic to handle tasks directly; let the worker process requests and execute core business rules.
- **Minimal Overhead:** Implement integrations and utilities inline or as simple helper functions to reduce complexity.

## Configuration & Environment
- **Typed Configurations:** Use environment variables for sensitive data, with clear TypeScript definitions.
- **Direct Usage:** Access configurations directly within your worker logic to avoid extra configuration layers.
- **Free Quota Awareness:** Design configuration settings with the constraints of Cloudflare's free quota in mind.

## Type Management
- **Centralize Types:** Define and reuse TypeScript types and interfaces for external API responses (e.g., Notion) and database records (Cloudflare D1).
- **Type Safety:** Leverage TypeScript to catch issues early and ensure consistency without adding extra abstraction layers.

## Integration Strategies
- **Notion API:** Handle API calls and responses directly, ensuring rate limits and error scenarios are managed within the core logic.
- **Cloudflare D1:** Interact with the database using straightforward queries; focus on performance and simplicity in data operations.
- **Quota Consideration:** Monitor and optimize API calls and database operations to stay within the Cloudflare free tier limits.

## Error Handling & Utilities
- **Streamlined Error Handling:** Use simple, centralized error management strategies that fit the lightweight nature of the worker.
- **Reusable Helpers:** Implement only the essential utility functions (e.g., logging, basic data transformations) to support the main logic.

## Testing
- **Integration Testing Only:** Only integration tests are allowed. Unit tests, end-to-end tests, and other test types are strictly prohibited.
- **Real Data Sources:** All tests must use actual resources (D1, R2, Notion) - no mocking or fake data is allowed.
- **Service Coverage:** Tests should aim to cover all services used in workflows, though formal coverage reporting is not required.
- **Write Operation Safety:**
  - Create new test data for write operations
  - Delete test data after test completion
  - Never modify existing production data
  - Never use delete-all or flush-all operations before tests
- **Data Integrity:**
  - Each test should be self-contained with its own test data
  - Clean up all test data after test completion
  - Ensure test data is clearly identifiable (e.g., with test_ prefix)
- **Resource Consideration:**
  - Be mindful of API rate limits when testing
  - Consider Cloudflare's free tier limitations in test design
  - Optimize test execution to minimize resource usage
  - If a resource is needed, try to find in `test/fixtures` like  [db.fixture.ts](mdc:test/fixtures/db.fixture.ts), [r2.fixture.ts](mdc:test/fixtures/r2.fixture.ts)

## Overall Guidelines
- **Keep It Simple:** Avoid over-designing the project. Embrace the straightforward nature of Cloudflare Workers and Bun to keep the codebase maintainable and efficient.
- **Focus on Performance:** Prioritize fast execution and low latency by reducing unnecessary dependencies and processing layers.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent approach to types, configurations, and error handling throughout the project.
- **Free Tier Compliance:** Constantly consider Cloudflare's free quota limitations in every aspect of design and implementation.

## Note
- Every time when you want to create something new, check the codebaese first to avoid duplications.
- Every time when you adding or updating code, fix all the lint errors before you finish.
